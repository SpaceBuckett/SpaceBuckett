--👋 Hey, this is Space Bucket (ahm ahm! I mean Shehzad Ahmad aka weirdo). A curious nerd who is always overthinking about the tiny questions and is always in search 👀 of data validated answers to those different weird questions. 
--Hey bro, if you have such built-in problems, why don’t you try the field of Data Science, ha?
--That’s what I am doing, searching for the answers to the various questions that can add value to the betterment of the society and plays vital role in solving some of the major problems, all by using the art and science of the “Data Science”. The amazing this that fascinates me are the different Machine Learning algorithms that really are going to change the world in much better way. 
--Also, I am going through the journey of learning developing mobile applications using flutter. It helps me to apply the outcomes of trained ML models and connect them to some interface that really can add value to someone 😊
